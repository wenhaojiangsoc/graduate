# The Role of Graduate Education in the Rising Wage Premium for Professional and Managerial Occupations, 1980-2019

Repository for replication codes for the paper *The Role of Graduate Education in the Rising Wage Premium for Professional and Managerial Occupations, 1980-2019* under Revise and Resubmit in *Social Forces*. 

## Overview about the Repository

This repository hosts the codes that we used to generate the results of the paper. Due to restrictions on file sizes, we do not include the raw Census and ACS data, but users interested in replication can easily download the original data using the `xml` file in `data/raw/extract.xml`.

Most codes are self-explanatory. Users interested in using the Kim (2010) decomposition in a longitudinal setting, as in ours, may use the function we manually created in `codes/01_weighted_kim_function.R`, with proper citation to Kim ([2010](https://doi.org/10.1177/0049124110366235), [2013](https://doi.org/10.1177/0081175013481959)). Errors are our own.

The full appendix can be found in `supplemental materials/full appendix.docx`.
